## Setup

### Get The Project

This whole site is on github at https://github.com/NikitaVr/OpenStats

Navigate to where you want to have your OpenStats Project folder to be.

For these steps you need to have git installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/NikitaVr/OpenStats
cd OpenStats
```

Now with RStudio open `OpenStats/R/R.Rproj`

### Create your own branch

Create a new branch from `master`. Label it with what you are planning to work on, for this demo we just call it `myBranch`.

What it should look like after the new branch is created:

Now inside your local OpenStats repository run:

```
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout myBranch
```
